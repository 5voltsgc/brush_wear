# brush_wear
reads a serial input from  scale weighing brush samples

With a scale connected to the serial port this program will read the weight
on the scale and input it into the appropriate input box to do calcuations on 
the weight change from the previous weighing.  

Need to weight 3 different brushes 500 times or 1,500 samples.  This program is
to automate it, to help improve accuracy.
